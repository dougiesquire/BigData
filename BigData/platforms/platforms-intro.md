# Computing Platforms

There are a wide range of computing platforms available to climate data users in Australia. As a general rule when working with large datasets, user experience will be best when utilizing computational resources as close to the dataset as possible. For example, where computational resources are provided alongside the data to be analysed, users should try to utilize these resources before downloading the data to their local computing platform. 

In Australia, there is a vast quantity of climate and related datasets hosted at the [National Computational Infrastructure](https://nci.org.au/) (NCI) High Performance Computing (HPC) facility located at the Australian National University in Canberra. As such, much of our documentation assumes familiarity or use of this system, but this section covers a few options and notes about various systems people might work on.

The datasets hosted on NCI may be centrally managed, e.g. by NCI (CMIP, ERA5) or the community (precipitation data, other reanalyses). An interface to help researchers identify what climate data is available and where is under development.

This section contains information on when and how to access the following systems, as well as FAQs as they emerge.
