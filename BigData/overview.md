# Overview

This Jupyter Book is a compilation of resources and best practices for climate scientists in Australia who work with big/challenging datasets. This book is intended for both dataset creators and dataset users. While the focus is on Australian climate scientists, many of the resources listed here are generally applicable.

This book was created as part of a working group formed at the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society's Annual Conference 2021. See [Australian Climate Data Guide working group](overview:working-group) for more information about the working group.

This book is meant to be a collaborative resource, and we welcome contributions! Instructions on how to contribute can be found in the book's [github repository](https://github.com/ACDguide/BigData).

This Jupyter Book is currently under development, so expect frequent updates.

# Our target reader
This book is intended for users with a range of prior knowledge and experience. Our target readers include:
- People new to climate data analysis
- People familiar with climate data analysis moving to a new system/language/institution
- People who are experience with climate data analysis who are looking for new tools or specific advice

# Australian Climate Data Guide working group

Our ultimate goal is to **create a best practices framework for climate-related scientists in Australia working with big/challenging datasets.**

```{admonition} What's a "big/challenging dataset"?
A “big/challenging dataset" is a dataset whose size and complexity is such that “traditional data-processing application software” is inadequate to handle the analysis or management of the dataset ([Wikipedia page for “Big data”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data); [Pangeo FAQ](https://pangeo.io/faq.html))
```

To achieve this goal, we aim to:
- Identify weak points/missing gaps in existing resources
- Expand documentation, create learning modules, etc. to fill the identified gaps in currently available resources
- Consolidate a list of software, tools, learning/training modules, relevant documentation, and other resources that currently exist for dealing with, specifically for storing, accessing, and analyzing, big data.
- Expand documentation, create learning modules, etc. to fill the identified gaps in currently available resources
- Communicate with other working groups (e.g. on data management guidelines) on issues related to improving data organization
